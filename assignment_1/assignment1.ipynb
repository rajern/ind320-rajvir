    "1. **A Jupyter Notebook** run locally on your computer (later with access to online and local databases).\n",
    "   - This will be your basic development and documentation platform.\n",
    "   - Must include a brief description of **AI usage**.\n",
    "   - Must include a **300–500 word log** describing the compulsory work (including both Jupyter Notebook and Streamlit experience).\n",
    "   - Must include **links** to your public **GitHub repository** and **Streamlit app** (see below) for the compulsory work.\n",
    "   - Document headings should be clear and usable for navigation during development.\n",
    "   - All code blocks must include enough **comments** to be understandable and reproducible if someone inherits your project.\n",
    "   - All code blocks must be **run before export to PDF** so messages and plots are shown. In addition, add the `.ipynb` file to the GitHub repository where you have your Streamlit project.\n",

    "2. **A Streamlit app** running from `https://[yourproject].streamlit.app/`.\n",
    "   - This will be an online version of the project, accessing data that has been exported to CSV format (later, also an online database).\n",
    "   - The code, hosted at GitHub, must include relevant comments from the Jupyter Notebook and further comments regarding Streamlit usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are **four parts** in the project work, building on each other and resulting in a final portfolio and app to be presented at the end of the semester.\n",
